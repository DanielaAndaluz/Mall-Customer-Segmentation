# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
In this project I attempted to cluster customer data using 3 different clustering algorithms: K-means, Agglomerative Clustering and Optics. The project is divided into two sections: in the first one the fitting part is executed and in the second, the visualization is carried out in order to analyze the results.
